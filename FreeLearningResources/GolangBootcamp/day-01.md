# Day 1: Search and Shell Basics

## Search, Self-Discovery, and Independence

You need to know how to discover new information independently.

    - I know, this seems "too easy"... but seriously, this is the most important skill of your career! There is a reason this is item #1. If you aren't efficient in discovering new information on your own about problems you don't understand, it will be difficult to succeed as a software developer in any form. This helps you gain independence and prevents you from being blocked on getting better at anything you do, which enables you to succeed and get ahead in your field.

    - :warning: Your workplace might have policies in place that prevent the use of AI, so use caution here...
    - I would _NOT_ recommend using auto-generated code for any work you submit directly. Not only is it legally ambiguous at this time (2024) but code generated by AI is also often incorrect, incomplete, and full of bugs.
    - I would _HIGHLY_ recommend using auto-generated code to learn new things and create quick proofs of concept! If there's something in this guide that confuses you - ask AI and you'll likely get a reasonable response (which you can follow up with some research of your own using established resources like official documentation). For example asking questions like `what is golang context?` or `how would I mock time in golang?` or `how do I stop a golang program from panic errors?` or `write me a golang function that makes a call to list all the open PRs of a github repository` can give you incredibly valuable leads on what "unknown unknowns" (information you don't know you don't know) exist in a given problem, and at least make them "known unknowns" (information you are aware of, but still maybe don't understand and can follow up on).


## Bash Basics

Learn how to interact with the Linux shell `bash`. If you don't have access to a Linux machine directly or haven't used it before, you can create a bootable flash-drive to use without modifying your local system at all (often called "live usbs"). If you haven't used Linux before, I'd recommend starting with the Linux distro [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview).
